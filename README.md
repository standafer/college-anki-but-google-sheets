# college-anki (but google sheets)
My [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) resources throughout college. If just want the decks, check out the my [college-anki](https://github.com/standafer/college-anki) [CrowdAnki](https://github.com/Stvad/CrowdAnki) repository. You can import all cards from there. This just has the Google Sheet for reference if it might be useful to you.

It has (hopefully) pretty comprehensive cards on the following topics:
1) Calculus I at Solano Community College
2) Advanced Programming with C++ at Diablo Valley College
3) General College Chemistry I at Diablo Valley College
4) Structures and Interpretations of Computer Programs at Laney College
